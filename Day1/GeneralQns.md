## General SQL Questions

1. **What is SQL?**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases. It allows you to perform tasks such as creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data from databases [3].

2. **What are the main types of SQL statements?**
   - The main types of SQL statements are Data Definition Language (DDL) statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), and Data Control Language (DCL) statements (GRANT, REVOKE) [3].

3. **What is the difference between a table and a view?**
   - A table is a collection of data elements organized in rows and columns, stored in a database. A view, on the other hand, is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement. It contains rows and columns, just like a real table, but it does not physically store data [3].

### Basic SQL Questions

4. **What is the difference between SELECT and INSERT statements?**
   - The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database, while the INSERT statement is used to insert new data into a database [2].

5. **What are primary keys and foreign keys?**
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for a record in a table. A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that is used to link to the primary key in another table [2].

6. **What is the purpose of the WHERE clause?**
   - The WHERE clause is used to filter records and extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition [2].

### Intermediate SQL Questions

7. **What are the different types of joins in SQL?**
   - The main types of joins are INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL JOIN. Each type of join returns a different set of records based on the matching criteria between the tables [2].

8. **What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?**
   - UNION combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicate rows. UNION ALL combines the result sets and does not remove duplicate rows [5].

9. **What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING in SQL?**
   - WHERE is used to filter records before any grouping takes place. HAVING is used to filter records after the grouping has been done [5].

10. **What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**
    - SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not use SQL and are designed to handle unstructured data [5].

These questions cover a range of topics from basic to intermediate SQL concepts. Preparing answers to these questions will help you demonstrate your understanding of SQL and its applications in database management.
