1. **DROP TABLE**:
   - `DROP TABLE` is used to remove an entire table from the database schema.
   - When you execute `DROP TABLE`, it permanently deletes the table structure along with all of its data, indexes, triggers, and constraints.
   - This operation cannot be rolled back, and the table and its data are irretrievably lost.
   - Example: `DROP TABLE table_name;`

2. **DELETE**:
   - There is no SQL command named `DELETE TABLE`. Instead, `DELETE` is used to remove rows (data records) from a table.
   - When you execute `DELETE FROM table_name`, it removes specific rows from the table based on the specified conditions or criteria.
   - This operation only removes the data records (rows) from the table, leaving the table structure intact.
   - The `DELETE` operation can be rolled back within a transaction if needed.
   - Example: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;`

In summary:
- `DROP TABLE` deletes the entire table structure along with its data irreversibly.
- `DELETE` removes specific rows (data records) from the table while keeping the table structure intact.
