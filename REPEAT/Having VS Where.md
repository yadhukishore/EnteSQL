The `HAVING` and `WHERE` clauses in SQL are used for filtering data, but they are used at different stages of query execution and with different purposes:

1. **WHERE Clause**:
   - The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows from the result set based on a specified condition.
   - It is applied to individual rows before they are grouped or aggregated.
   - It is used with the `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `MERGE` statements.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM orders WHERE total_amount > 1000;
     ```

2. **HAVING Clause**:
   - The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups of rows from the result set based on a specified condition.
   - It is applied after the rows have been grouped using the `GROUP BY` clause.
   - It is used with aggregate functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, etc.
   - It is used to filter groups rather than individual rows.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id
     HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
     ```

In summary:
- The `WHERE` clause filters individual rows before grouping and aggregation.
- The `HAVING` clause filters groups of rows after grouping and aggregation.

You use `WHERE` to filter rows based on conditions on individual columns, whereas you use `HAVING` to filter groups of rows based on conditions on aggregated values, such as the result of `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.
