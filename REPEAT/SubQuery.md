SQL Subqueries are essentially queries within queries. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. **What is a Subquery?**
   - A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a SELECT statement embedded within another SQL statement, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
   - The outer query contains the subquery, and the result of the subquery is used by the outer query to perform further operations.

2. **Where Can Subqueries Be Used?**
   - Subqueries can be used in various SQL clauses, such as WHERE, HAVING, SET (in UPDATE statements), and VALUES (in INSERT statements).
   - They can also be used with comparison operators like =, >, <, >=, <=, as well as other operators like IN, BETWEEN, etc.

3. **Rules for Writing Subqueries:**
   - Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses.
   - They can be nested within another subquery.
   - A subquery must always contain the SELECT statement and the FROM clause.
   - They can contain various SQL clauses like GROUP BY, WHERE, HAVING, DISTINCT, etc.

4. **Types of Subqueries:**
   - Scalar Subqueries: Return a single value.
   - Row Subqueries: Return a single row.
   - Column Subqueries: Return a single column.
   - Table Subqueries: Return a whole table.

5. **Examples of Subqueries:**
   - Subqueries can be used with SELECT statements to filter rows based on certain conditions or to retrieve specific data.
   - They can also be used with INSERT statements to insert data from one table into another based on certain conditions.
   - Subqueries can be used with UPDATE and DELETE statements to update or delete rows based on conditions derived from another table.

In summary, subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow for complex data retrieval and manipulation by nesting queries within each other. They are versatile and can be used in various SQL statements to perform operations based on the results of another query.
