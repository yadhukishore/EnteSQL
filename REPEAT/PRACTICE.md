Certainly! Here are some more SQL practice questions similar to the ones you've encountered:

1. **Find the average salary of employees in each department.**

2. **Retrieve the names and email addresses of employees who joined the company before 2010.**

3. **List the departments with more than 5 employees.**

4. **Find the employee(s) with the highest salary in each department.**

5. **Calculate the total number of employees in each city.**

6. **Retrieve the names of employees who do not have a manager.**

7. **Find the departments where the average salary is higher than $60,000.**

8. **List the names of employees who have the same last name as their manager.**

9. **Find the top 3 departments with the highest average salary.**

10. **Retrieve the names of employees who have been with the company for more than 5 years.**

These questions cover a range of SQL concepts including joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, filtering, and sorting. Practice solving these questions to improve your SQL skills and become more comfortable with writing queries for various scenarios. Additionally, you can create your own scenarios and SQL questions based on your understanding of the database schema.


here's an example of how you could create and insert data into tables for practicing the SQL queries:

```sql
-- Create a table for employees
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    hire_date DATE,
    department_id INT,
    manager_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    city_id INT
);

-- Create a table for departments
CREATE TABLE departments (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create a table for cities
CREATE TABLE cities (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Insert sample data into the departments table
INSERT INTO departments (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'HR'),
(2, 'Finance'),
(3, 'Marketing');

-- Insert sample data into the cities table
INSERT INTO cities (id, name) VALUES
(1, 'New York'),
(2, 'Los Angeles'),
(3, 'Chicago');

-- Insert sample data into the employees table
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, email, hire_date, department_id, manager_id, salary, city_id) VALUES
(1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com', '2010-01-15', 1, NULL, 60000.00, 1),
(2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com', '2015-03-20', 2, 1, 75000.00, 2),
(3, 'Michael Johnson', 'michael@example.com', '2012-07-10', 1, 1, 55000.00, 1),
(4, 'Emily Brown', 'emily@example.com', '2018-05-01', 3, 3, 65000.00, 3),
(5, 'David Wilson', 'david@example.com', '2014-09-30', 3, 3, 70000.00, 3);
```

This script creates three tables: `employees`, `departments`, and `cities`. Then it inserts sample data into each of these tables. You can use this sample data to practice the SQL queries provided earlier. Feel free to modify the data or schema as needed for your practice.


Sure, here are the SQL queries to answer each of the questions along with the corresponding results:

1. **Find the average salary of employees in each department.**
```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```
Result:
```
| department_id | average_salary |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1             | 57500.00       |
| 2             | 75000.00       |
| 3             | 67500.00       |
```

2. **Retrieve the names and email addresses of employees who joined the company before 2010.**
```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < '2010-01-01';
```
Result:
```
| name           | email             |

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
LIMIT 3;

These SQL queries demonstrate various functionalities such as aggregation, filtering, joining, and sorting, which are commonly used in SQL queries.
