`SHOW` and `SELECT` are both SQL commands used to retrieve information from a database, but they serve different purposes:

1. **SHOW**:
   - `SHOW` is a SQL command used to retrieve metadata about database objects such as tables, columns, indexes, or stored procedures.
   - It is used to display information about the structure or properties of database objects rather than the actual data stored in those objects.
   - Common `SHOW` commands include `SHOW TABLES`, `SHOW COLUMNS FROM table_name`, `SHOW INDEX FROM table_name`, etc.

2. **SELECT**:
   - `SELECT` is a SQL command used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database.
   - It is used to query and retrieve specific data records or values from the tables based on specified conditions.
   - `SELECT` statements can also be used to perform calculations, apply functions, or perform operations on the retrieved data.
   - Common `SELECT` queries include `SELECT * FROM table_name`, `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name`, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name`, etc.

**In summary**:
- `SHOW` is used to retrieve metadata about database objects.
- `SELECT` is used to retrieve data records from tables.
